# Desafio MV  
- This is a technical test for [MV sistemas](https://mv.com.br/) that consists of a simple system of register/login and a CRUD in `java`  
- That was my first api (and code) in java  
- The frontend was deployend on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and the backend on [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
